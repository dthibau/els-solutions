# Explicit mappings match any token sequence on the LHS of "=>"
# and replace with all alternatives on the RHS.  These types of mappings
# ignore the expand parameter in the schema.
# Examples:
orm => object relational mapping
ex => exemple
tp => atelier

# Equivalent synonyms may be separated with commas and give
# no explicit mapping.  In this case the mapping behavior will
# be taken from the expand parameter in the schema.  This allows
# the same synonym file to be used in different synonym handling strategies.
# Examples:
javaee, j2ee, jee

# If expand==true, "ipod, i-pod, i pod" is equivalent
# to the explicit mapping:

# If expand==false, "ipod, i-pod, i pod" is equivalent
# to the explicit mapping:
angularjs => angularjs angular
